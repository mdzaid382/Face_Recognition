- Face detection is a process of identifying human faces in images or videos. It is a rapidly
  expanding area of computer vision that offers a variety of useful applications, such as security systems,
  face identification, and picture analysis.
- As my first Python Project i am not utilising complex deeplearning neural networks like CNN to built my project but
  in future hope i will.
  
- It's a simple Face recognition model using openCV module and face_recognition module.

  ### openCV :
  -OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is very popular among open-source computer vision libraries.
   It offers a range of algorithms and capabilities for processing images and videos, including face detection.
   OpenCV provides a pre-trained Cascade Classifier based on Haar cascades to recognize faces in photos and videos.
   This classifier analyses portions of a picture and seeks patterns that mimic facial features.

  ### face_recognition :
  - The Python module face_recognition provides a simple user interface for face detection and recognition tasks.
  - we can provide the images of person and it will recognise it perfectly.
